## Built with

- HTML
- CSS

## What I learned

For this challenge, I tried to use relative unit of measurement (rem)

I also learned new HTML attribute for responsive image

```html
<picture>
   <source srcset="images/image-product-mobile.jpg" media="(max-width: 375px)">
    <img src="images/image-product-desktop.jpg" alt="Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum">
</picture>
```

## Continued development

One problem with my solution is that it's only responsive to 375px and 1440px screen. I'll try to make it more responsive with different screen sizes
